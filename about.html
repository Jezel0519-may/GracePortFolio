			<h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
			<p>Hi, welcome to my <strong>Website!</strong></p>
			<p>
				My name is Grace C. Pelingon, 20 years of age. I lived at Blk 6 Lot 6 Apras Floodway Cainta, Rizal. I was born on 29th day of October year 2000 at Quezon, City. We are three sisters. In other word, tres marias. One of my sister is my twin. She is Kris C. Pelingon and we are fraternal twin. It is not difficult to identify who I am and who my twin is. While my youngest sister is Mary Jane C. Pelingon. My mother is a housewife. When there are sidelines that she can handle, she grab the opportunity. I can't deny that she cooks well that's why I'm gaining weight. Hence, my father died when I was in 7th grade. My hobbies are dancing, singing, listening to music, watching movies, playing badminton and volleyball. I am a consistent achiever since my junior year until on my senior year. I became a Math Quiz Bee and IT Infographics Representative way back when I was in Senior Highschool. I was awarded as Best in Conduct and Best in Christian Formation when I was in my senior year as well. I'm currently studying at Cainta Catholic College as a 2ndyear student taking up the course of Bachelor of Science Major in Computer Science. I was grateful for having a chance to continue my studies with the help of scholarships/financial assistance that I have now.
